<happy>Hi!
<explain>So,
I want to tell you about our plan 
<happy> for the text to video project
<explain> We will create a pipeline
that only includes the most essential parts.

The second thing is that we need to figure out
<rq> what the length of the input transcript should be
<happy> Let me explain with an example
<explain> In order to produce this video, I needed to give a transcript as input
<confused>I have no idea how long this video will take
<explain>So,
<rq>we need to come up with a way to determine the duration of the video
based on the input

The last thing we are going to focus on 
<happy>is creating a plan by setting milestones for ourselves
<happy>We will also be breaking down tasks, so that they can be completed in one day

<happy> This concludes this video. Thank you for listening bye!
